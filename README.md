## 📖 Overview

This project implements a sophisticated **ReAct-style AI agent** using LangGraph and Flask that can intelligently decide which tools to use based on user queries. The agent has access to multiple information sources and can seamlessly combine results to provide accurate, well-researched responses.

### 🧠 How It Works

The agent follows a **Reasoning + Acting** approach:

1. **🔍 Analyze** user query to understand information needs
2. **🎯 Plan** which tools (if any) are required
3. **⚡ Execute** selected tools to gather information
4. **🧬 Synthesize** results into a coherent response
